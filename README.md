# Quarkus Framework VS Spring Framework

The idea behind this repository is to expose a comparison between the freshness and cutting edge technology offered by [Quarkus](https://quarkus.io/) versus the maturity and stability provided by [Spring](https://spring.io/).

This repository is divided into two parts, a part where a comparison is made at code level the different most common technologies, under the imperative and reactive paradigm and another part where the performance of each framework is compared, also under the imperative and reactive paradigm.
