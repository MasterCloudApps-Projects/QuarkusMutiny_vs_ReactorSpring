# Comparative Quarkus Framework VS Spring Framework

This part intends to emphasize that **Quarkus** can be a good candidate when creating applications, the low level of configuration required and the great flexibility and speed of promoting it to a productive environment makes it an equal or even better option than **Spring**.

The comparison is offered in two different flavors, one is the **imperative** approach, which is widely used in a large number of applications, and the other is the **reactive** approach, not so common, but slowly gaining popularity in a large number of use cases.
