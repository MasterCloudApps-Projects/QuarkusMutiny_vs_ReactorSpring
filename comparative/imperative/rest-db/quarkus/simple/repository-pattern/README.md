# Quarkus API Rest and Hibernate ORM with Panache

This project is built using the [Quarkus Framework](https://quarkus.io/).

The application exposes an API Rest, which uses [RESTEasy](https://resteasy.dev/) implementation of the JAX-RS specification, that is connected to MySQL database using *Panache*, a library similar to Spring Data JPA, simplifying the most common database operations.

Mention Panache has two difference implementations, the repository pattern and the active record pattern, in this example we use the repository pattern, this means that all database operations are contented in repository layer, it's so common to see this in Spring Data JPA.

## Set Up ⚙

You must have installed on your machine:
* JDK 11 version
* Apache Maven 3.8.1
* Docker

If you already have it installed, you must run the following command:

```bash
docker run --name mysql-tfm -d -e MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=password -e MYSQL_DATABASE=imdb -p 3306:3306 mysql:8.0.26
```

Next, you should wait a few seconds (5s - 10s) for MySQL will finish booting. Now, you need to [download](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MasterCloudApps-Projects/QuarkusMutiny_vs_ReactorSpring/main/imperative/rest-db/imdb_movies.sql) the script for the database, then you can execute the following command:

```bash
docker exec -i mysql-tfm mysql -uroot -ppassword imdb < imdb_movies.sql
```

## Start Up 🛠

There are two option:

1. Development

    You can run your application in dev mode:

    ```bash
    ./mvnw clean compile quarkus:dev
    ```

2. Production

    First, the application must be packaged using:

    ```bash
    ./mvnw package
    ```

    It produces the `quarkus-run.jar` file in the `target/quarkus-app/` directory. Now, the only thing left to do is to run the application:

    ```bash
    java -jar target/quarkus-app/quarkus-run.jar
    ```

## Testing 🔍

The application has an OpenAPI dependency, providing a Swagger interface to make requests against to the API, click [here](http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui/) to test it.
