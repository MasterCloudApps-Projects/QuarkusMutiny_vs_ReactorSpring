# Quarkus and WebSockets

This project is based to [Quarkus](https://quarkus.io/).

The application provides an user interface where the user can see how many users are connected in that moment. 

If you look at the implementation it's absoluly different that imperative implementation, the reason is that uses [SmallRye Reactive Messaging](https://smallrye.io/smallrye-reactive-messaging/smallrye-reactive-messaging/3.13/index.html) based on event-driven, data streaming, and event-sourcing applications


## Set Up ‚öô

You must have installed on your machine:
* JDK 11 version
* Apache Maven 3.8.1

## Start Up üõ†

There are two option:

1. Development

   You can run your application in dev mode:

    ```bash
    ./mvnw clean compile quarkus:dev
    ```

2. Production

   First, the application must be packaged using:

    ```bash
    ./mvnw package
    ```

   It produces the `quarkus-run.jar` file in the `target/quarkus-app/` directory. Now, the only thing left to do is to
   run the application:

    ```bash
    java -jar target/quarkus-app/quarkus-run.jar
    ```
