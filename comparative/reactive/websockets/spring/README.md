# Spring and WebSockets

This project is based to [Spring Boot](https://spring.io/). Here, we have made use of [Spring WebFlux](https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/docs/current/reference/html/web-reactive.html) as well, because the reactive websocket is contained in Spring WebFlux. 

Now, we doesn't have [STOMP](https://stomp.github.io/stomp-specification-1.2.html#Abstract) or [SockJS](https://github.com/sockjs/sockjs-client) as in the imperative implementation because Spring doesn't provide this possibility. In this example, it uses the raw [WebSocket API](https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/docs/current/reference/html/web-reactive.html#webflux-websocket-server).
