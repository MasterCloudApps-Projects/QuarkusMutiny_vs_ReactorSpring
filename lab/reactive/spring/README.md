# Spring WebFlux and Data Access with R2DBC

This project is built using the [Spring Boot](https://spring.io/projects/spring-boot).

The application exposes a Reactive API Rest, which uses [Spring WebFlux](https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/docs/5.3.15/reference/html/web.html#mvc), that is connected to MySQL database using the [Data Access with R2DBC](https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/docs/current/reference/html/data-access.html#r2dbc) dependency for reactive connection.

Unfortunately, the Data Access with R2DBC does not support JPQL and it is necessary to write simple SQL queries.
